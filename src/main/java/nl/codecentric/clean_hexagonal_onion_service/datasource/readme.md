###DataSource Adapter
The DataSource Adapter realizes the implementation of the Repository as defined by DDD in the Domain Interaction 
Layer. The Repository implementation ensures Aggregates can be persisted (mapped to the data model) and restored 
(mapped from data model to domain model) once needed.
